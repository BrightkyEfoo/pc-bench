# PC Bench Documentation

## Overview
**PC Bench** is a Node.js library designed for comprehensive hardware and performance analysis of a computer system. Built with TypeScript for type safety, it provides tools to:

- Retrieve detailed system hardware information (CPU, GPU, RAM, storage, etc.).
- Test the performance of various components (CPU frequency, RAM speed, disk I/O).
- Measure network quality and latency.
- Run benchmarks on multi-core processors and handle multithreading.

This documentation provides an overview of each API, detailed descriptions of their outputs, and usage examples.

### 3. `testRAM`
#### Description
Tests the RAM performance by measuring read/write speeds and latency.

#### Example Usage
```typescript
import { testRAM } from 'pc-bench';

const ramTest = await testRAM();
console.log(ramTest);
```

#### Output Structure
- **speed** (number): Measured RAM speed in MB/s.
- **latency** (number): Measured latency in nanoseconds.

---

### 4. `testDisk`
#### Description
Measures the performance of the storage disk, including read/write speeds.

#### Example Usage
```typescript
import { testNetwork } from 'pc-bench';

const networkTest = await testNetwork();
console.log(networkTest);
```

#### Output Structure
- **latency** (number): Network latency in milliseconds.
- **downloadSpeed** (number): Download speed in Mbps.
- **uploadSpeed** (number): Upload speed in Mbps.

---

### 6. `getGPUPerformance`
#### Description
Benchmarks GPU performance by running a synthetic workload.

#### Example Usage
```typescript
import { getGPUPerformance } from 'pc-bench';

const gpuPerformance = await getGPUPerformance();
console.log(gpuPerformance);
```

#### Output Structure
- **score** (number): GPU performance score.
- **temperature** (number): Measured GPU temperature during the test in Â°C.

---

### Additional Features

#### Logging
All functions accept an optional `logger` parameter to log the progress and results:

```typescript
await testCPU({ logger: console.log });
```
### Updated Usage Description for README (NPM)

Here is the revised version with titles one level lower:

### Using `testAll`

The `testAll` function is an asynchronous method designed to run a series of tests that validate system information and evaluate hardware performance. It provides detailed insights about your hardware (CPU, GPU, RAM, disk, and network) and performs multithreaded performance testing on your processor.

#### Features

- **System Information Retrieval and Validation**:
  - **CPU**: Manufacturer, model, frequency, physical/logical cores.
  - **GPU**: Manufacturer, model.
  - **RAM**: Total, used, and free memory.
  - **Disk**: Total, used, and available space.
  - **Network**: Interface, speed.
- **Multithreaded Performance Testing**.
- **Simulated Performance Tests** for RAM and disk speed.
- **Comprehensive Results** displayed directly in the console.

#### Example Usage

Here's how to use the `testAll` function in your project:

```typescript
import testAll from "<your-package-name>";

testAll()
  .then(() => console.log("All tests have been successfully executed."))
  .catch((error) => console.error("An error occurred during the tests:", error));
```

#### Expected Output

After executing the function, you will see a summary of the system information and performance tests directly in the console. For example:

```
==== Starting Tests ====
Test: Retrieving system information...
CPU Information: { manufacturer: 'Intel', brand: 'Core i7', speed: 3.6, cores: 8, physicalCores: 4 }
GPU Information: { manufacturer: 'NVIDIA', model: 'RTX 3060' }
RAM Information: { total: 16384, free: 8192, used: 8192 }
Disk Information: { total: 512000, used: 256000, free: 256000 }
Network Information: { interface: 'Ethernet', speed: 1000 }
System information validated.
Test: Multithreaded CPU performance...
Multithreaded Performance: 3500
Multithreaded performance validated.
Performance test results: {
  cpuFrequency: 3.6,
  gpuPerformance: 100,
  ramSpeed: 3200,
  diskSpeed: 500,
  multiThreadPerformance: 3500
}
==== Tests Completed Successfully ====
```

#### Notes of using testAll function

- This function is ideal for developers who want to quickly diagnose their system or evaluate machine performance.
- The additional tests (RAM speed, disk speed, etc.) use simulated values for demonstration purposes. You can customize these sections to suit your needs.

---

### Notes
- Ensure that the application has sufficient permissions to access hardware-level details.
- Running tests may consume significant system resources temporarily.
